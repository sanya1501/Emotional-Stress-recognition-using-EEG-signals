# Emotional-Stress-recognition-using-EEG-signals
In today's world, we are aware that stress is a common factor especially  among the youngsters, who do not even realize that how their mental health is being affected by this. Anxiety, and depression are too stress-related disorders that  impact people of all the ages.
so emotional stress recognition system tries to solve how quickly and correctly to measure people's emotional stress level by using some machine learning algorithms. 
Its goal is to develop an accurate system that can identify and categorize people's emotional states into 3 major categories. That is relaxed, stressed and neutral based on their EEG dataset . 
EEG  a non-invasive technique which is used to measure electrical activittes of brain. 
The algorithms used in this project are Svm, logistic, LSTM. Random forest, decision  trees,CNN.
